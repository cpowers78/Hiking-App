# <Hiking App>

## Description

My motivation in building this project is to provide an application that shows the user all of the hiking locations in a given area of their choosing.
I built this project because I love to hike and whenever I travel to a new place I want to know where all of the trails are located!

From this project, I learned how to incorporate Google Maps APIs into a React Application.


## Usage

Simply type in a location into the input box that you would like to see the hiking trails in. At this time, the application only works with a chrome extension called "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" because I am working on figuring out how to access the Google Maps Places API without it.

## Technologies Used

React, Material UI, Google Maps API
